# Customer analysis and customer seqmentation app
## Overview
The main goal is to analyze data to gain useful insights and then implement a machine learning model to group similar customers together, so the marketing team or sales team can reach out to them more effectively.
## Project goals
- Analyze the data and extract valuable insights to enhance business value.
- implementing customer segmentation model based on needs and behaviors, enabling us to target specific groups and thereby boost product sales.
## Steps
1. Data exploration: Trying to understand what the data contains, its size, and its column types.
2. Data processing: Transforming raw data into a well-formed dataset so that data mining analytics can be applied.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization: Applying data mining analytics to extract valuable insights, then visualizing the insights using visualization tools (Power BI and Matplotlib) to help stakeholders make the right decisions.
4. Feature engineering and Feature extraction: Selecting and transforming the most relevant variables from raw data when creating machine learning models, which can improve the performance of ML algorithms.
5. Machine learning model: ML algorithms like K-means and hierarchical clustering are used to cluster customers and dimension reduction algorithms, such as T-SNE, are used to reduce dimensions.
6. Deployment: The last stage is to help stakeholders easily use the ML model via a small software app.
